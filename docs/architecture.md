# AI GAME BOT — agent platform architecture (v1.3)

## Stage 1 — what existed and is reused
| Component | Where | Reused as |
|---|---|---|
| Screen capture (MediaProjection, fresh-frame requests) | `CaptureService` | Observation input for every external game |
| Accessibility gestures + floating panel | `TapService`, `NonogramMode.dispatch` | Control; `GestureExecutor` generalises it |
| Nonogram.com reader (grid, clues incl. two-digit/frozen, cells, red marks, hearts, fill switch; Challenge boards) | `nono/NonoVision`, `NextButton` | Perception of the `nonogram-com` adapter, unchanged |
| Exact nonogram solver | `nono/NonoSolver`, `game/nonogram/LineSolver` | Planner for Nonogram.com; baseline + puzzle validation |
| Built-in Nonogram (rules, seeded unique puzzles, train/eval split, env) | `game/nonogram/*` | Simulator of the `nonogram-sim` adapter |
| Learning core (linear Q-learning, replay, modes, model versions) | `learn/*` | Policy learning for any adapter with features |
| Auto next level | `AutoNext` | Level-transition handling |

## Shared core (`core/`, plain Java, desktop-tested)
| Concern | Class |
|---|---|
| Game profiles (versioned, history kept) | `GameProfile`, `ProfileStore` |
| Visual state extraction → structured state with confidence; OBSERVED / INFERRED / HIDDEN facts | `Perception`, `StateObservation` |
| Actions: tap, long press, swipe, drag path, hold/release, multi-stroke, macro record | `GameAction` |
| Action execution | `ActionExecutor` (Android: `GestureExecutor`) |
| Reward + progress detection, every reward names its source | `RewardModel` |
| Experience storage (state, action+timing, next state, reward+source, episode boundary, confidence, profile version) | `Experience`, `ExperienceStore`, `EpisodeRecorder` |
| When to stop acting | `SessionGuard` |
| Known adapters + shipped profiles | `Adapters` |
| Model versions, stable mark, rollback | `learn/ModelStore` |

Adapters: `nono/NonoComAdapter` (Nonogram.com perception + reward), `game/nonogram/NonoSimAdapter` (built-in game).

## Stage status
**Implemented and verified (desktop tests on the same Java, real phone screenshots):**
- Profiles: create, version, history, restore, refuse deleting shipped profiles (`tools/core/CoreTests`).
- Observations: Nonogram.com frames → structured state; Challenge board read in full; Level 8's 4 frozen clues marked HIDDEN; a non-game screen → UNKNOWN, confidence 0.
- Rewards from Nonogram.com's real signals (filled cells read back, red marks, hearts, Level Completed), each with a source.
- Experience store schema and episode boundaries; summary; clear.
- Session guard: stop, capture lost, control lost, other app in front, low confidence, non-gameplay/blocked screen, no-effect loop.
- Model stable mark + rollback.
- Built-in Nonogram rules/puzzles unchanged (bench tests pass).

**Implemented but unverified on a phone:**
- Nonogram.com sessions written to the experience store (START, one STEP per board check with the gestures since the last check as a macro action, END with reason).
- Game library, Add Game (installed apps), profile screen (objective, pace, experience, export/delete, versions), Mark stable / Roll back buttons.
- `GestureExecutor` (tap/long press/swipe/drag/hold-release/multi-touch): compiles against Android 34; not used by any game yet — Nonogram.com keeps its own proven gesture code.

**Requires configuration or external compute:** nothing in this stage.

**Not yet supported:**
- Games other than Nonogram: added games stay in CALIBRATING; nothing reads or controls them.
- Control calibration, rule hypotheses, demonstrations (stage 4); vision-language model backend (stage 5, opt-in, none connected);
  second game with different mechanics (stage 6); capture-rate/latency check for real-time games.
